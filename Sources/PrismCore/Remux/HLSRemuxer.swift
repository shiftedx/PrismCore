/// Stream-copies one video stream plus **every viable audio stream** out of any
/// container libavformat can demux, into HLS-fMP4 on disk — segmenting with our
/// own `FMP4SegmentWriter` (the `hls` muxer is absent from MPVKit's libavformat
/// build; see that type's doc) and writing the playlists ourselves.
///
/// This is the v0 producer: it starts at the head of the source and runs to
/// EOF, growing EVENT playlists AVPlayer can start playing immediately.
/// Cuts happen only at video keyframes at-or-after each `segmentSeconds`
/// boundary, so every segment opens decodable on its own (what the playlist's
/// `EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS` promises). Because it *stream-copies*, the
/// bits AVPlayer receives are the source's own: an EAC3+JOC (Atmos) track
/// stays object audio all the way to HDMI, and HDR metadata rides the
/// untouched HEVC bitstream.
///
/// Audio is the one place where "stream-copy" isn't the whole story: codecs
/// AVPlayer's fMP4 path can't take (TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, MP3, Opus, …) are routed
/// through `AudioBridge`, which decodes and re-encodes them to EAC3 so surround
/// survives (phase 3). Copyable audio never touches the bridge.
///
/// Text subtitles are carried too (phase 6), but never into the fMP4: their
/// packets go to `SubtitleRenditionSet`, which converts them to segmented WebVTT
/// renditions cut on these same boundaries. Bitmap subtitles are skipped — the
/// probe reports them so the host can draw its own overlay.
///
/// ## Two output shapes, and when each is used
///
/// - **Renditions** (the normal shape). The variant carries video only, and
///   each audio track becomes an HLS alternate rendition with its own segment
///   writer, playlist and subdirectory (`audio0/…`, `audio1/…`), wrapped by a
///   `master.m3u8`. This is what makes track switching possible at all: a
///   selectable audio group only exists in a master playlist.
/// - **Muxed** (the v0 shape, kept as the fallback). One audio track is muxed
///   into the video's own segments and the media playlist is served directly.
///   Used whenever a master playlist would be *dishonest or refused* — the
///   source has no derivable `CODECS` string (HEVC or H.264 with Annex-B
///   extradata), its dynamic range can't be declared to this display, or Dolby
///   Vision Profile 5 meets a non-DV display. Renditions live in the master, so
///   no master means the audio has to ride inside the variant or not at all;
///   falling back to v0's single muxed track is strictly better than serving
///   silence.
///
/// Phase 4 added two edits to the otherwise byte-for-byte video copy, neither of
/// which touches picture data:
///
/// - The `hvcC` is normalized into the form a `hvc1` sample entry has to have
///   (`HVCCNormalizer`). This happens **twice**, on purpose: on the input
///   extradata, which decides which parameter sets exist at all, and again on the
///   produced init segment, because the muxer rebuilds the record when it writes
///   the sample entry and leaves `array_completeness = 0` under a `hvc1` name.
/// - A Dolby Vision Profile 7 source has its RPUs converted to 8.1 with the
///   enhancement layer dropped (`DolbyVisionRPUConverter`), so a dual-layer file
///   Apple can't decode arrives as a single-layer one it can.
