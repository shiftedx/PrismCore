/// single-layer HDR10-base stream it does.
///
/// ## What P7 actually is, and what conversion means
///
/// Profile 7 is the Blu-ray shape: an HDR10 base layer, a separate enhancement
/// layer, and an RPU written in *dual-layer* form. No Apple platform decodes the
/// enhancement layer. Profile 8.1 is the same HDR10 base with a *single-layer*
/// RPU — so the conversion is two edits and no re-encode:
///
/// 1. rewrite each RPU (NAL type 62) into its 8.1 form, and
/// 2. drop the enhancement layer — every `unspec63` NAL (type 63). NOT "every
///    non-zero `nuh_layer_id`", which is what this used to say and do: an
///    interleaved P7 stream puts the EL, the RPU and the base layer all on
///    layer 0, so that test never matched and the EL survived into a stream
///    declared single-layer (see `isEnhancementLayer`).
///
/// The base layer's picture NALs are untouched: the bits AVPlayer receives are
/// still the source's own, which is the whole premise of the remux path. What the
/// viewer loses is the enhancement layer's extra precision — which was
/// unreachable anyway, since the alternative for these files is Prism, where DV
/// dies at the door entirely.
///
/// ## Availability
///
/// libdovi does the RPU surgery — the same library mpv uses, already linked into
/// MPVKit's `_FFmpeg` target, so this adds no dependency. It is nonetheless
/// behind `canImport`: if a host builds against an MPVKit that doesn't export the
/// module, the converter reports itself unavailable and P7 sources keep routing to
/// Prism. Same discipline as `AudioBridge` and the missing `eac3` encoder — a
/// capability that can't be delivered says so rather than failing at playback.
